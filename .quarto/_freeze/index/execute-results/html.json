I used data taken from the nflverse dataset, along with wikipedia.org and nflsavant.com. The data was cleaned by finding the specific player and all their data, to compare NFL combines, with x being the player, and y being the value taken at the combine (measured by the measure used by the NFL). The data concluded most NFL stars that I collected data from have had better numbers than the league average in at least two of the three combine drills I used for my data, except safeties. who generally had worse combines than the league average.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
